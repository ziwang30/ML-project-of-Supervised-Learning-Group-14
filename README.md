# ML project of Supervised Learning Group 14
The code file name is code of project(.py format), the data file name is dataset. 
How to run:
1. Download data, unzip
2. Change the file path in code file
3. run it 
Note:
The code contains a hyperparameter process, so it takes a certain amount of time to run. If you don't want to run a hyperparameter process, you can run the code according to the following parameter settings:
The weight of KNN is Minkowski distance, the best k is 1. 
The  parameters and weights of ANN, Activation is tanh, weight optimization(solver) is adam, the best learning rate is constant 0.001, The optimal number of hidden layers is 7, and each layer of neurons is 60.

thank you!
